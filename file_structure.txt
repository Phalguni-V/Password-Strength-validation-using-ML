### Zipped File Structure Overview

The zipped file is organized into the following sections to facilitate navigation and understanding:

1. **Baseline Models**  
   This section contains the code and rendered outputs for the baseline models using two datasets.  
   - **Code:**  
     Contains the baseline code for two datasets.  
     - Dataset 1: Password lengths 12 and 15.  
     - Dataset 2: Password lengths 12 and 24.
   - **Rendered Files:**  
     HTML versions of the baseline code for easy viewing, including both the code and results.

2. **Tuned Models**  
   This section contains the hyperparameter-tuned models and their corresponding rendered outputs.  
   - **Code:**  
     Contains the hyperparameter-tuned code for the two datasets.  
     - Dataset 1: Password lengths 12 and 15.  
     - Dataset 2: Password lengths 12 and 24.
   - **Rendered Files:**  
     HTML versions of the tuned code for easy viewing, including both the code and results.

3. **Datasets**  
   This folder includes the two datasets used in the project in CSV format.

4. **Plots**  
   Contains two folders (Dataset 1 and Dataset 2) with evaluation plots for each dataset. These are further divided into folders for each password length used (e.g., 12, 15, 24).

5. **Computational Time Plotting**  
   Contains a small code used to plot the computational time taken for different password lengths.

6. **requirements.txt**  
   A file listing the necessary dependencies to execute the code in the project. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install these dependencies.
